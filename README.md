# SearchQueryClassification
Data Mining Class Project - Stanford Summer'17

Background:
Returning a search result that is relevant to the search query.
"Search engines typically use hundreds of signals to determine the relevance of the document and then return a list of documents in the order of relevance."

Dataset:
Training set:
  10 attributes and 80,046 observations from a search engine query and url data.
  10 different signals that could be used to help predict whether the url is relevant for the query.
 
Test set:
  30,001 observation
  
Goal of the project: Make relevance prediction for each row (urls for a query) in the test dataset.
Task: To create a text file containing a 0 or a 1 in each line, which is the relevance prediction of the model on the test set.
